-- When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you are working on the same project with other people. And/or when you want to backup your work!

-- Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repo.

Because sometimes you may want to choose not yet to pull changes as they may conflict with you work untill than.

-- Describe the differences between forks, clones and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks: when you want to clone a repository but you don't have rights to add changes to that repository, you can fork the repo and make your own changes to it without changing anything to de original repo.
Clones: Clone a repo if you want to make changes to it and you want to share those changes with the owner of the original repo.
Branches: Branch if you want to add a new feature, fix a bug or experiment with content.

Forks are different from Clones in the way of interaction with the original users of the repo.
Branches are parts of clones or forks that can exist on a local machine or in more colaborating way's

-- What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

The benefit is that when pulling from GitHub that the changes will not be that big and an easy merge can be done. 

-- How would you collaborate without using git or github? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

I would collaborate bij manually making a central repo and copying it to local machines every time i would be working on it.
Collaborating without git or github would be much harder because you'll have to manually check changes of collaborators and manually merge files etc..
