-- When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you are working on the same project with other people. And/or when you want to backup your work!

-- Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repo.

Because sometimes you may want to choose not yet to pull changes as they may conflict with you work untill than.
